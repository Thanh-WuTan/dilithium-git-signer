# Dilithium Git Commit Signer

A CLI tool to sign and verify Git commits using the CRYSTALS-Dilithium post-quantum digital signature scheme, built with [`dilithium-py`](https://github.com/GiacomoPope/dilithium-py). This tool is for educational purposes only and should not be used in production due to lack of side-channel protections.
